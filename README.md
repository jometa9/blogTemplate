- To create a post without text editor or running in localhost (it only works if you can upload a post wit only one YouTube video, this is my case):
Go ro repository, select "Issues":
        
    - New issue, select the "New post form".
    - Fill all form content.
    - Create the issue. Uala! New post created.
